# js-roguelike-rooms

A project for creating a simple JavaScript roguelike with connected rooms.

The structure of this project is as follows: 

* There is a project with a bunch of TODO's in the code that you can complete.

* There is a completed version that you can refer to for reference.

Both versions have identical directory structures.

For guidance, see Nevin's [tutorial](https://nevkatz.medium.com).

That's about it. Enjoy!
